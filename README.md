Identifying customer segments using unsupervised learning

In this project, I have appled unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a 
mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest 
expected rate of returns. The data that I have used has been provided by Udacity partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics.


Steps include cleaning, PCA and clustering
